OWGIS has become a well stablished open source software for the automatic generation of Web-GIS sites that
display geotemproal data, especially ocean and climate. The latest version of OWGIS
incorporates outstanding visualizations with analysis tools that allow an easier understanding
of the data. Some of the features added recently are: dynamic vertical profiles with temporal animations,
3-dimensional animations of vector fields using streamlines, earth view,  automatic
generation of mobile interfaces and APK files, and dynamic time series. Additionally, OWGIS
allows the advanced users to customize the design of the websites with custom color palettes,
multiple base maps, and complete toolbox to improve the streamline animations. 
In this work the latest version of OWGIS is described and a sucesfull use case,
the meteorological atlas of the Gulf of Mexico, is presented as an example.
